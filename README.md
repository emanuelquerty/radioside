## Radioside

Radioside is a radio application for streaming radio stations from all over the world.
Users can browse and listen to radio stations by country or language. In addition, users also can view
and listen to their recently played stations.

I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do :).

## Live Url

Please, notice that the app is currently on beta version. Although most of the features have been fully tested
and already working, some features are still lacking behind and there is a possibility of minor bugs.
I hope to fix all the currently known bugs and deploy the final working version soon.
